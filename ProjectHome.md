# What is pysta #
A GUI for python, that use my tridi 2D/3D software rendering engine that simulate a complete Windows Vista Desktop, like Aero Glass effect,taskbar, startmenu,tray,widget/sidebar,3D task switcher, etc.

Currently, after 4 days work, i have implement these feature:
# taskbar, data and time
# window Aero look and effect
# some simple component : button, edit, checkbox, radio, page/tabbed
# effect that can be turn on/off :
**Blurry form background** Glassy form
**Fade in/out** Maximize/restore

**Update** Mar-2009

Now Linux Wine compatible, if Wine installed, i think now every linux has wine preinstalled, even the live cd.

For performance, i have recoding almost 25% of xtridi.exe removing all 3D components. Maybe i should change the name to xtodi, now its get improvement from 2X until 3X !!!!
